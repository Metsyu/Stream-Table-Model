Process.java:
	
	Process.java contains the program source code.
	
	
PARAMETERS.txt:
	
	PARAMETERS.txt contains the editing parameters (https://photoeditor.polarr.co/ was used to apply the edits)
	for the filter that was applied to the raw images before running Process.java.
  
  
RUN1:
	
	RUN1 contains already edited images that can be used to run and test the program.
	
	
Instructions for running the program are as follows:
	
	Before running the program, open Process.java in a text editor or an IDE of your choice.
	The "TODO" sections will then need to be completed. Insert a directory of your choice, replacing the 
	YOUR DIRECTORY HERE text. Examples of acceptable directories are provided in the comments of the program.
	
	Once the "TODO" sections are completed, save the file.
	
	After saving and executing the program, you will be prompted to enter a folder (e.g. RUN1). If the folder entered 
	is invalid, you will be prompted to enter one again. Once a valid folder is entered, the program will 
	convert the images and then save them to the directory that you insterted on line 151.
